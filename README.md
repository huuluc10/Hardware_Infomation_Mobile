Project Title: CPUZ Clone
This project aims to create a clone of the popular system information tool, CPUZ. The application will provide detailed information about the user's device, including but not limited to:

Processor details (name, architecture, clock speed, number of cores)
System information (operating system, system uptime, user privileges)
Memory details (total memory, used memory, memory speed)
Storage details (total storage, used storage, type of storage)
Graphics details (graphics card name, driver version, memory)
The application will be designed with a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to navigate and understand their system information. It will also include features for exporting the data to a text or CSV file for further analysis.

This project is developed using Flutter and is intended for users who want to understand more about their computer's hardware and system specifications.
